# App pictures
There was no designer for the app, so I had to create the design. It looks not good, but it is functional.

# About the project
It was for my internship project. I had to fetch data from Woocommerce REST API and add search functionality. In addition as you can see catalog page, shopping page and registration page. However, I couldn't finish search functionality since REST API didn't provide a method to do so. You can read about Woocommerce REST API here: http://woocommerce.github.io/woocommerce-rest-api-docs/#authentication
# Getting started with EsteKz
 Android for este.kz web-site. As data added to the web-site it will be displayed in the app. If for some reason, it doesn't show data, it is probably because host turned off REST API of the web-site.
# Note
I left consumer key intentially because these keys only allow to read data. Please, don't try in any way to write to it, it won't be possible.
# Hope, it will help you in some way. 
I just getting started so don't judge too harsh)
